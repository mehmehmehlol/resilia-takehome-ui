# Take Home Assignment: Mini Notification System [UI]
Author: Megan Lo

## Description
The goal of this assignment is to display a list of notification with arbitrary domain data in this mini notification system app.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the terminal of this repository and type in the following:
```bash
npm i
```
to ensure all the npm packages of this repo is installed in your local machine.

## To Get Started
1. Please make sure to follow the instructions on [resilia-takehome-api](https://github.com/mehmehmehlol/resilia-takehome-api#take-home-assignment-mini-notification-system-api) as we want to make sure the server/API is up and running in order for our frontend application to display the notifications.
2. After ensuring the API is working, go back to the terminal of this repository and type in the following:
```bash
npm start
```
Since the API have used up your local machine's default `localhost` port (ex: `localhost:3000`/`localhost:8000`), it may ask you if you want to use another port. Simply type `y`.
